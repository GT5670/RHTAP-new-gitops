About Red Hat Developer Hub
Red Hat Developer Hub (RHDH) is an enterprise-grade internal developer portal designed to simplify and streamline software development processes. Combined with Red Hat OpenShift, RHDH empowers platform engineering teams to create customized portals that improve developer productivity, accelerate onboarding, and enable faster application delivery. By reducing friction and complexity, RHDH allows developers to focus on writing high-quality code while adhering to enterprise-class best practices.

RHDH integrates software templates, pre-architected solutions, and dynamic plugins into a centralized platform, providing tailored solutions for operations and development teams in a unified environment.

Benefits of Red Hat Developer Hub
For developers:

Simplified access to tools, resources, and workflows through a centralized dashboard.
Self-service capabilities with guardrails for cloud-native development.
Streamlined software and service creation using pre-configured templates.

For Platform engineers:

Tailored platforms with curated tools to support developers efficiently.
Centralized repositories for consistent configuration management.
Simplified governance of technology choices and operational processes.

For organizations:

Scalability to onboard new teams quickly while maintaining consistency.
Enhanced security with enterprise-grade Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
Cost and time efficiency by mitigating cognitive load and eliminating workflow bottlenecks.

Key features
Centralized Dashboard: Provides a single interface for accessing developer tools, CI/CD pipelines, APIs, monitoring tools, and documentation. Integrated with systems like Git, OpenShift, Kubernetes, and JIRA.

Dynamic Plugins: Add, update, or remove plugins dynamically without downtime. Popular plugins like Tekton, GitOps, Nexus Repository, and JFrog Artifactory are supported and verified by Red Hat.

Software Templates: Simplify development processes by automating tasks such as repository setup, variable insertion, and production pipeline creation.

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Manage user access with robust security permissions tailored to organizational needs.

Scalability: Support growing teams and applications while maintaining access to the same tools and services.

Configuration Management: Centralized repositories ensure synchronized updates, improving version control and environment configuration.

Integrations in RHDH
Integration with Red Hat OpenShift
RHDH is fully integrated with Red Hat OpenShift, offering:
Operators to manage application lifecycles.
Access to advanced OpenShift capabilities such as service mesh, serverless functions, GitOps, and distributed tracing. <Add names of other plugins that are more imp, check with Christophe on this.>
Pipelines and GitOps plugins for streamlined cloud-native workflows.

Integration with Red Hat trusted application pipeline (RHTAP)
RHTAP enhances RHDH by providing secure CI/CD capabilities that integrate security measures into every stage of the development process.

While RHDH focuses on the inner loop (code, build, and test), RHTAP manages the outer loop, automating:

Code scanning
Image building
Vulnerability detection
Deployment

RHTAP includes tools like Red Hat Trusted Artifact Signer (RHTAS) for code integrity, Red Hat Trusted Profile Analyzer (RHTPA) for automated Software build of Materials (SBOM) creation, and Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security (RHACS) for vulnerability scanning. 

Extending Backstage with RHDH
RHDH which is a fully supported, enterprise-grade productized version of upstream Backstage extends the upstream project by adding:

Enhanced search capabilities that aggregate data from CI/CD pipelines, cloud providers, source control, and more.
A centralized software catalog for locating applications, APIs, and resources.
Automation through open-source plugins that expand Backstageâ€™s core functionality.
Simplified tech documentation using Markdown and Git, with integrated search for easy navigation.
