= About Red Hat Developer Hub

Red Hat Developer Hub (RHDH) is an enterprise-grade Internal Developer Portal (IDP) that simplifies and accelerates software development within organizations. It provides a customizable developer portal that integrates with Red Hat OpenShift and other cloud-native technologies to create a consistent environment for building, deploying, and managing applications.

RHDH acts as a central platform where development teams access source code repositories, CI/CD pipelines, APIs, and technical documentation. By integrating these tools and services, Red Hat Developer Hub establishes "golden paths" â€“ predefined, best-practice workflows that guide developers through common tasks efficiently.

The outcome is increased developer productivity and satisfaction: engineers spend less time searching for resources or configuring infrastructure and more time writing high-quality code that meets enterprise standards.

== Understanding Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs)

An Internal Developer Platform is a curated set of integrated tools and services that provides a self-service platform for software developers within an organization. Rather than requiring developers to navigate multiple systems manually (source control, CI/CD, environments, monitoring), an IDP offers a streamlined experience where these systems are coordinated by a dedicated platform team.

The platform team configures automation and default "golden path" configurations for common tasks (such as creating a microservice or provisioning an environment), which developers can use with minimal effort through a portal, CLI, or APIs. The IDP removes repetitive setup work without hiding necessary context, balancing convenience with transparency.

=== Why IDPs matter

Internal Developer Platforms address the complexity of modern cloud-native development through:

* *Self-service capabilities*: Developers complete recurring tasks through self-service interfaces instead of filing tickets. Automation reduces manual errors and accelerates the development lifecycle.

* *Standardized workflows*: The platform includes pre-approved technology stacks, configurations, and processes that follow best practices. These "golden paths" ensure all projects meet organizational standards for security, compliance, and reliability.

* *Consolidated knowledge*: The developer portal serves as the primary source for discovering internal APIs, services, and documentation. This breaks down information silos by centralizing content previously scattered across wikis, ticket systems, and team repositories.

* *Enhanced developer experience*: By reducing cognitive load and providing a coherent interface, an IDP allows developers to focus on coding and solving business problems rather than managing infrastructure. This leads to faster onboarding and increased engineering productivity.
