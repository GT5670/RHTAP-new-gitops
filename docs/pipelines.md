Upon the installation of {ProductShortName}, cluster administrators have the capability to tailor the {RHDHLongName} portal with specific templates and enhancements. This customization process is crucial for enabling developers to focus primarily on coding by simplifying development workflows and mitigating concerns related to pipelines, vulnerabilities, and policies.

Before proceeding with customization, it's essential for cluster administrators to familiarize themselves with the available software and pipeline templates through this guide. Such exploration is key to grasping how {ProductShortName} supports a secure supply chain, laying the groundwork for any subsequent customization.

== Setting the stage

* Ensure you have successfully installed {ProductShortName}.

** If you integrated Jenkins during the installation of {ProductShortName}, you must link:https://placeholder.com[configure Jenkins with the appropriate credentials] before using the secure software templates.

** If you integrated Bitbucket while installing {ProductShortName}, ensure the following prerequisites are met, as the secure software templates require them to create a source repository at the correct location:

*** link:https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/create-a-project/[Create a project] in a Bitbucket link:https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/what-is-a-workspace/[workspace].

*** link:https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/app-passwords/[Create an app password] in Bitbucket.

* Log in to {RHDHLongName} ({RHDHShortName}) using the link provided by {ProductShortName} installer at the end of the installation process.

== Build an application

On the {RHDHShortName} portal, select *Create*, and then select an appropriate template. For example, Quarkus Java - Trusted Application Pipeline.

Building an application or microservice for your developers in {RHDHShortName} using the templates offered by {ProductShortName} is essentially only a three step process:

* Provide application information

* Provide application repository information

* Provide deployment information

====

. Select *Review* to review all the information that you added.

. Select *Create*.  {ProductShortName} initiates a sequence of automated tasks that are pivotal for setting up your application's infrastructure and deployment pipeline. This process involves several key operations that unfold behind the scenes:

+
* *Repository Creation and Configuration:* A new repository is automatically created in your specified hosting service (GitLab or GitHub), tailored specifically for your application. This includes the setup of both the GitOps repository, which holds your deployment configurations, and the source repository, where your application code resides.

* *Argo CD Integration:* With the repositories in place, Argo CD resources are created and configured. Argo CD, a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool, springs into action, orchestrating the deployment of your application across the specified namespaces.

* *Namespace Creation:* As part of setting up your deployment environments, various namespaces are automatically generated based on your application's requirements. This includes separate namespaces for development, staging, and production environments, ensuring isolation and security between stages.

* *Pipeline Definition:* Finally, a pipeline definition is added to your setup, providing you with a 'Pipeline as code' model. This defines the automated workflow for building, testing, and deploying your application, aligning with best practices and security measures.

== Review your application

Once you've successfully created an application using {ProductShortName}, reviewing its components, source code, GitOps configurations, and associated documentation is straightforward. 

*Quick analysis*

For a quick review, click the links that the system displays on the "Run of ..." page. The links provide information for important resources such as:

* Source repositories

* GitOps repositories

*Comprehensive analysis*

For a detailed analysis, follow these steps:

* Select *Open Component in catalog* or you can also navigate to the *Catalog* where the system lists your newly created application.

* *Examine the Source Code:*

+
. Go to the *Overview* tab and select *View Source* to open the repository where your application's source code is housed. This step provides insight into the construction and logic of your application.

* *Review deployment history:*

+
. Go to the *Overview* tab and navigate to the Deployment summary section to review the summary of your applicationâ€™s deployment across namespaces. Additionally, select an appropriate Argo CD app to open the deployment details in Argo CD, or select a commit ID from the Revision column to review the changes in GitLab or GitHub.

* *Review GitOps repository:*

+
. On the *Overview* tab, use the *Kind* dropdown to select *Resource* and find the relevant GitOps repository.
. Choose *View Source* to examine the GitOps configurations directly. Alternatively, for a broader overview including technical documentation, select *View TechDocs* from the *Catalog* section and then choose the GitOps repository under the *Home* > *Repository* section.


* *Review the Documentation:*

+
. From the *Overview* tab, click *View Tech Docs*.
. This opens the technical documentation for your application, providing detailed insights into its features, configuration steps, and how to utilize it effectively.

== (Optional) Unregister your application

This process removes the application's source and GitOps repository from your catalog and resource view, essentially hiding it. The application itself remains functional within the cluster. Unregistered applications can be re-registered at any time.

. Navigate to the *Catalog* and select the component that you want to unregister.

. Select vertical three-dot menu associated with the component, and then select *Unregister entity*. A confirmation dialog appears.

+
image::unregister.png[]

. Select *Unregister Location*. This removes the application's Git repository from your catalog view.

. Navigate to the *Catalog*, from the *Kind* drop down list, select *Resource*, and then unregister the corresponding GitOps resource.

. Remove the application from the cluster, by running the following command:

+
[source,bash]
----
oc delete application your-app-name-app-of-apps -n rhtap # <1>
----
<1> `rhtap` is the default namespace. Additionally, `your-app-name` is the name of your application.
