# Passive Voice Rule

Avoid using passive voice. Write in active voice whenever possible to improve clarity, reduce ambiguity, and enhance reader engagement.

Passive voice hides the subject performing the action. In technical writing, always make the actor clear when possible.

## 🧠 How to Identify Passive Voice

- Look for forms of **"to be"** + **past participle** (e.g., *was written*, *is completed*, *will be done*)
- The agent (doer) may be missing or introduced with **"by"**
- Subject receives the action instead of performing it

---

## ✅ General Rewrite Strategy

1. Identify the verb phrase (e.g., *was processed by*)
2. Identify the agent (e.g., *the system*)
3. Make the agent the subject of the sentence
4. Rewrite using an active verb form
