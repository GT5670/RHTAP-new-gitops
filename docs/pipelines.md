= About Red Hat Developer Hub

Red Hat Developer Hub (RHDH) is an enterprise-grade internal developer portal (IDP) that simplifies and accelerates software development. It provides a customizable web-based portal that connects to Red Hat OpenShift and other cloud-native platforms, creating a consistent environment for building, deploying, and managing applications.

RHDH centralizes access to source code repositories, CI/CD pipelines, APIs, documentation, and runtime environments. Developers follow predefined workflows—called golden paths—that reduce complexity and promote best practices.

RHDH improves developer productivity, reduces tool sprawl, and ensures consistent delivery across teams.

== Understanding Internal Developer Platforms

An internal developer platform (IDP) is a curated set of tools and services that supports developer self-service. Instead of navigating multiple systems, developers use a unified interface to perform tasks such as provisioning environments, deploying code, or accessing APIs.

The platform team builds and maintains the IDP. Developers consume it as a product. This structure balances autonomy with governance.

=== Why IDPs Matter

IDPs address the challenges of modern software delivery:

* *Self-service and automation:* Developers complete common tasks without raising tickets. Automation reduces errors and wait times.
* *Standardization:* Golden paths enforce secure, compliant, and reliable practices.
* *Centralized knowledge:* Portals consolidate documentation, ownership details, and service metadata.
* *Improved experience:* Developers spend less time switching contexts and more time building features.

== Key Features of Red Hat Developer Hub

RHDH provides integrated features that help teams move from idea to production quickly and consistently.

=== Centralized Dashboard

Access all development tools, pipelines, APIs, environments, and documentation from a single interface. RHDH integrates with Git repositories, Kubernetes, OpenShift, and project management tools.

=== Software Catalog

The software catalog is the core of RHDH. It provides a searchable inventory of internal services, APIs, applications, and libraries.

* Discover existing components quickly.
* View ownership, metadata, and status at a glance.
* Standardize structure across all entries.
* Search code, docs, and infrastructure in one place.

=== Software Templates

Templates generate preconfigured project scaffolding, including CI/CD, runtime, and security configurations.

* Create projects in minutes.
* Enforce best practices and organizational standards.
* Empower developers to self-serve within defined boundaries.
* Use AI-focused templates to build intelligent applications faster.

=== Tech Docs

Tech Docs in RHDH make documentation part of the development lifecycle.

* Write docs in Markdown.
* Store docs alongside code.
* Search and view docs in the portal.
* Follow a consistent structure across all teams.

=== Learning Paths

Learning Paths help developers onboard and upskill with curated tutorials and guides.

* Complete structured onboarding.
* Follow interactive, step-by-step guides.
* Learn modern topics, including AI/ML.
* Access internal and external training resources.

=== Plugins and Integrations

Use plugins to integrate external tools and extend RHDH functionality.

* Add verified, Red Hat–supported plugins.
* Reduce context switching with unified dashboards.
* Update or remove plugins without downtime.
* Integrate with OpenShift, pipelines, scanners, and more.

=== Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

RHDH includes enterprise-grade RBAC.

* Control access to resources by role.
* Secure sensitive operations.
* Meet enterprise compliance standards.
