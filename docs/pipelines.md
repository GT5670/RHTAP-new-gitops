2. Add more information to the existing About section on RHDH from the perspective of Developers and first time users of RHDH.
We will be creating more developer focused content on Software catalog, templates and tech docs, Learning paths (specially relevant from AI perspective ) and Plugins. Some of this is already available. Add links to existing sections and create placeholder links for those that are not yet done.
