Jenkins: Highlight how to change dynamic library code to using Jenkins installed library
During program call, this doc update came up from Simon Baird and John Duimovich:
RHTAP could pull more Jenkins info from the build if there was a trusted Jenkins library. To have a trusted Jenkins library, it would change how the Jenkins server is provisioned. If this change was made to the default configuration RHTAP uses for Jenkins, then EC could take advantage of this configuration to do better EC attestations. This is currently hidden to the customer. If things are set up correctly, RTHAP could take advantage of setup.  
For 1.3, It was decided to not make any changes to the default Jenkins configuration. This change will com later, possibly in 1.4.
 BUT from Johnâ€™s perspective, we could add a small paragraph in the 1.3 timeframe stating that we currently use dynamic loading. If the user wants to customize the template they can change things to not use dynamic loading. Jenkins users would probably know how to change dynamic library code  in install library in Jenkins, but a small paragraph could be added.
John suggested an RN entry and offered to help write the content, but perhaps this update would live better outside of RN either in Configuring Jenkins topic or Customizing RHTPA topic.
