Release Notes guide
Abstract
Red Hat Developer Hub is a developer platform for building developer portals. This document contains release notes for the Red Hat Developer Hub 1.2.

Preface
Red Hat Developer Hub (Developer Hub) 1.2 is now generally available. Developer Hub is a fully supported, enterprise-grade productized version of upstream Backstage v1.26.5. You can access and download the Red Hat Developer Hub application from the Red Hat Customer Portal or from the Ecosystem Catalog.
Benefits of Red Hat Developer Hub include:
Increased developer productivity: Increases productivity by eliminating common organizational challenges, enabling seamless collaboration, and providing clear guidelines for creating, developing, and deploying applications.
Unified self-service dashboard: Provides development teams with a unified dashboard covering various aspects such as Git, CI/CD, SAST/DAST?, Supply Chain, OpenShift/Kubernetes cluster, JIRA, monitoring, API, documentation, and more, facilitated by over 150 plugins. All curated by a platform engineering team, aligning with the company’s best practices. - Static application security testing (SAST) and dynamic application security testing (DAST) - testing methodologies that help find security vulnerabilities that could leave an organization's applications susceptible to attack.
Best practices through software templates: Automates organizational best practices by encoding common tasks such as creating new applications, running Ansible jobs, and establishing CI/CD pipelines for production deployment in Git.
Scalable technical documentation: Code and documentation resides in the same repository, eliminating dependencies on proprietary document systems.
Efficient onboarding for new developers: New developers quickly adapt and become productive within a short timeframe.
Robust enterprise Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Empowers administrators to create roles, assign users or groups to roles, and implement robust security policies for enhanced access control.
Red Hat Developer Hub incorporates various dynamic plugins. Red Hat fully supports certain plugins, while others are community-supported projects. Some plugins are enabled by default, while others require configuration and are consequently disabled by default.
To get a comprehensive list of supported dynamic plugins, see the Preinstalled dynamic plugins section in the Configuring plugins in Red Hat Developer Hub guide.
Getting started Guide
Abstract
Red Hat Developer Hub is an enterprise-grade platform for building developer portals. You can configure and customize your Developer Hub instance to meet your needs and preferences.
Preface
As a developer, you can use Red Hat Developer Hub to experience a streamlined development environment.
