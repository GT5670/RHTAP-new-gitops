About Red Hat Developer Hub

Red Hat Developer Hub (RHDH) is an enterprise-grade Internal Developer Portal (IDP) designed to streamline application development and foster innovation. Built on the upstream Backstage project, RHDH integrates seamlessly with Red Hat OpenShift to provide platform engineering teams with a centralized, customizable platform. This platform helps reduce developer friction, simplify onboarding, and improve productivity by offering pre-architected, supported approaches and a comprehensive suite of development tools.

RHDH enables organizations to:
Boost developer productivity by reducing obstacles and increasing focus on writing quality code.
Simplify governance of technology choices through self-service with guardrails.
Centralize tools, templates, and resources to ensure consistency and scalability.


Key Features and Benefits

Centralized Development Platform
RHDH provides a unified platform that reduces cognitive load and development friction by:
Offering pre-architected templates to streamline application creation and deployment.
Centralizing tools, resources, and best practices in a consistent location.
Accelerating the development process while maintaining code quality and security.

Enhanced Developer Experience
Self-Service with Guardrails: Empower teams to build cloud-native applications without being distracted by infrastructure complexities.
Dynamic Plugins: Add, update, or remove plugins dynamically without downtime, ensuring uninterrupted development.
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Manage user access with granular security permissions tailored to organizational needs.

Integration with Red Hat OpenShift
Fully integrated with OpenShift for seamless access to technologies like service mesh, GitOps, serverless, and distributed tracing.
Supported pipelines and GitOps plugins designed to optimize OpenShift integration.

Improved Scalability and Configuration Management
Simplify onboarding for new teams and scale infrastructure as your organization grows.
Centralize configuration management for synchronized access to tools and documentation.

Enterprise-Grade Tools and Support
Supported and Verified Plugins: Integrate technologies like Tekton, GitOps, Ansible, and JFrog Artifactory with confidence.
Security and Support: Access robust security resources, patches, and premium support for uninterrupted productivity.


Additional Capabilities

Software Templates
RHDH includes prebuilt templates for quickly creating new resources, such as websites, applications, and microservices. These templates:
Simplify development by automating repetitive tasks.
Support customization to align with specific organizational needs.

You can install RHTAP to enhance Red Hat Developer Hub (RHDH) by adding secure CI/CD workflows with secure templates. While RHDH focuses on the inner loop (code, build, and test), RHTAP covers the outer loop by automating code scanning, image building, vulnerability scanning, and deployment. 

RHTAP includes tools like Red Hat Trusted Artifact Signer (RHTAS) for code integrity, Red Hat Trusted Profile Analyzer (RHTPA) for automated Software build of Materials (SBOM) creation, and Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security (RHACS) for vulnerability scanning. 

Together RHTAP and RHDH provide an end-to-end solution that simplifies and secures your software development lifecycle.

Extending Backstage Functionality
RHDH extends the upstream Backstage product by adding:
Integration with OpenShift for seamless development workflows.
Enhanced APIs for aggregating data across CI/CD systems, cloud providers, and source control platforms.
Simplified tech documentation management with Markdown and Git for easy updates.

Featured Plugins and Resources
A curated ecosystem of open source and enterprise-grade plugins to extend functionality.
Access to developer resources, articles, and eBooks for insights and best practices.
