I have a comment on the Verification section

in that section, you have mentioned about using Kubernetes tab to see the rollouts & analysisruns, which is also correct but it is not related to redhat-argocd plugin

Our verification should be something like, once the user does some changes in the gitops repository then rollout and analysisrun information should be visible in the resources table in redhat-argocd plugin's side panel
